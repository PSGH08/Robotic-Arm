# Robotic Arm – Team Golden Dragon

This repository contains the code and design files for the **Robotic Arm** project developed by **The Golden Dragon Team**. As the lead programmer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the control system, coordinating servo movement, and ensuring reliable task execution.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to build a programmable robotic arm capable of performing basic manipulation tasks such as gripping, lifting, and positioning. The system demonstrates principles of robotic kinematics, servo motor control, and embedded system integration.

**Key Objectives:**
- Multi-axis articulated movement
- Coordinated servo control
- Modular mechanical structure
- Manual and automated operation modes
